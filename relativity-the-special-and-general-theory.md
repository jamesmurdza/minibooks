## 1. Physical Meaning of Geometrical Propositions

In school, we all learned about the grand structure of Euclid's geometry. We were chased around and tested on its propositions for countless hours. Most of us would confidently assert that these propositions are true, but if asked to explain what we mean by "true," we might stumble. Geometry is based on conceptions like planes, points, and straight lines, and we accept certain simple propositions (axioms) as true because they align with these ideas. The other propositions are then proven from these axioms. However, the question of the truth of these propositions is ultimately meaningless and cannot be answered within the realm of geometry. The concept of "truth" implies correspondence with real objects, but geometry is concerned solely with the logical connection of ideas, not their relation to objects of experience. Although this is the case, we still feel compelled to call the propositions of geometry "true" because they align with our observations of the physical world.

The ideas of geometry correspond to objects in nature, and these objects shape the development of our geometrical concepts. However, in order to maintain logical unity, geometry should refrain from anchoring itself to physical objects. Instead, it should focus on the logical relations between its ideas. We are accustomed to thinking of distances as the separation between two marked positions on a rigid body observed from a particular vantage point. If we add to the propositions of Euclidean geometry the idea that two points on a rigid body always correspond to the same distance, regardless of changes in position, then the propositions of geometry become statements about the relative positions of these rigid bodies. In this way, geometry can be seen as a branch of physics. We can then question the "truth" of geometrical propositions by considering whether they hold up when we use ruler and compass to construct them. However, this truth is based on limited experience, and in the future, we may discover its limitations in the general theory of relativity.

## 2. The System of Co-ordinates

In order to measure distances between points on a rigid body, we need a standard measurement, like a rod. By marking off this measurement repeatedly from one point to another, we can determine the numerical measure of the distance between them. This concept is fundamental in all measurements of length.  When describing the position of an object or an event, we rely on the reference point of a rigid body. For example, when we say "Times Square, New York," we are referring to a specific point on the rigid body of the Earth.  However, we can expand our understanding of position beyond just the surface of rigid bodies. For instance, if there is a cloud above Times Square, we can use a pole to determine the position of the cloud relative to the Earth's surface. By measuring the length of the pole and specifying the position of its base, we have a complete description of the cloud's position.

To further refine our understanding of position, we can employ the Cartesian system of coordinates. This system consists of three perpendicular plane surfaces attached to a rigid body, and using this system, we can determine the position of an event by measuring the lengths of the three perpendiculars dropped from the event to the coordinate planes. The measurement process follows the rules of Euclidean geometry.  In practice, the actual rigid coordinate surfaces may not be available, and the measurements of the coordinates are obtained indirectly. However, it is crucial to always seek the physical meaning of position specifications based on these concepts, to ensure clarity in the results of physics and astronomy.  In summary, every description of events in space requires a reference to a rigid body, and the laws of Euclidean geometry play a role in determining the distances and positions involved.

## 3. Space and Time in Classical Mechanics

Understanding the motion of bodies in space is the aim of mechanics, but the concept of "position" and "space" can be confusing. Imagine dropping a stone from a moving train, disregarding air resistance. From the train, it appears to fall in a straight line, but to a pedestrian, it follows a parabolic curve. So, which is it? The key is to replace the vague term "space" with the notion of motion relative to a reference point, like the train or the ground. In this case, the stone moves in a straight line relative to the train, but in a parabolic curve relative to the ground. We must also consider time and specify at what point the object is at a given time. Classical mechanics offers a solution by using two identical clocks, one held by the person on the train and the other by the person on the ground. They each note the stone's position at each tick of their clocks. However, we must also consider the inaccuracy due to the finite speed of light.

## 4. The Galileian System of Co-ordinates

In the study of mechanics, we have the law of inertia, which states that a body will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. This law not only explains the motion of bodies but also tells us the permissible reference frames or systems of coordinates that can be used in mechanics. The fixed stars in the sky are excellent examples of bodies that adhere to the law of inertia. However, when we use a coordinate system fixed to the Earth, we observe that the fixed stars appear to move in circular paths over the course of a day. This contradicts the law of inertia. To resolve this contradiction, we need to consider coordinate systems where the fixed stars do not move in circles. We call such coordinate systems Galilean systems of coordinates. Therefore, the laws of mechanics proposed by Galilei and Newton are applicable only within a Galilean system of coordinates.

## 5. The Principle of Relativity in the Restricted Sense

In order to better understand the concept of relativity, let's imagine a scenario where a raven is flying through the air in a straight line. If we observe the raven from a moving train, we will notice that its motion appears different in terms of velocity and direction, but it still remains uniform and straight. This observation leads us to the principle of relativity, which states that if an object is moving uniformly in a straight line with respect to one coordinate system, it will also move uniformly and in a straight line with respect to another coordinate system that is moving uniformly in relation to the first system. This principle holds true as long as the second system is not rotating. This principle of relativity has been widely accepted, especially in the domain of classical mechanics, where it accurately describes the motions of celestial bodies. However, with the development of electrodynamics and optics, it became clear that classical mechanics alone is not sufficient to describe all natural phenomena. This raised questions about the validity of the principle of relativity. Despite these doubts, there are two compelling arguments in favor of its validity. Firstly, the accuracy of classical mechanics in describing the motions of celestial bodies suggests that the principle of relativity holds true in the realm of mechanics. Secondly, if the principle of relativity does not hold, then different coordinate systems that are moving uniformly relative to each other would not be equivalent in describing natural phenomena. This would imply that there is a preferred reference frame, which contradicts the idea of relativity. Additionally, it has been observed that there are no physical differences in different directions in terrestrial space, further supporting the principle of relativity.

## 6. The Theorem of the Addition of Velocities Employed in Classical Mechanics

Imagine a train moving at a constant speed along its tracks. Inside the train, a man is walking from one end to the other with his own speed. How fast is the man moving relative to someone watching from the side of the tracks? It seems that if the man were to stand still for a moment, he would move forward with the same speed as the train. But since he is walking, he covers an extra distance in that same amount of time. So, his overall speed relative to the observer is the sum of his walking speed and the speed of the train. However, this idea is not completely accurate in reality. Nevertheless, for now, let's assume it is.

## 7. The Apparent Incompatibility of the Law of Propagation of Light with the Principle of Relativity

Have you ever wondered about the principles behind the propagation of light through empty space? It seems simple, right? We learn in school that light travels in straight lines at a constant velocity. But did you know that this seemingly straightforward law has actually led physicists into great intellectual difficulties? It all boils down to the concept of relativity. Let's imagine a scenario where a ray of light is sent along an embankment. According to our belief in the constancy of the velocity of light, the tip of the ray will be transmitted with the same velocity relative to the embankment. Now, let's introduce a railway carriage traveling in the same direction as the ray of light but at a much lower velocity. If we consider the velocity of light relative to the carriage, it appears to be smaller than the velocity relative to the embankment. This creates a conflict with the principle of relativity, which states that the same laws of nature should apply regardless of the reference frame. According to our previous consideration, it would seem that a different law of propagation of light must hold for the carriage, contradicting the principle of relativity. At this point, we are faced with a choice: abandon the principle of relativity or the simple law of the propagation of light. But neither option seems satisfactory. The principle of relativity appeals to our intellect because of its simplicity and naturalness. On the other hand, the empirical data and investigations of Lorentz suggest that the constancy of the velocity of light is a necessary consequence of a theory of electromagnetic phenomena. Out of this dilemma emerged the theory of relativity. Through an analysis of the physical concepts of time and space, it became clear that there is no inherent incompatibility between the principle of relativity and the law of propagation of light. In fact, by adhering to both principles, a logically consistent theory could be developed. This theory, known as the special theory of relativity, provides the foundation for our understanding of the fundamental ideas at play. In conclusion, the propagation of light in vacuum and the principle of relativity are not at odds with each other, as initially thought. Instead, they can coexist in a rigorous and logical theory. This insight, provided by the special theory of relativity, paves the way for further exploration and understanding of the mysteries of the physical world.

## 8. On the Idea of Time in Physics

Imagine a scenario where lightning strikes two different places on a railway embankment simultaneously. At first glance, this statement seems reasonable, but when asked to explain it further, we realize it's not so simple. The concept of simultaneity is not easy to define in physics. The physicist needs a definition of simultaneity that can be tested in an actual case. Without this, the statement loses its meaning.  One suggestion to test simultaneity is to measure the distance between the two places and place an observer at the midpoint. The observer would use an arrangement of mirrors to visually observe both places at the same time. If the observer sees the lightning flashes simultaneously, then they are considered simultaneous.  However, there is a dilemma. We cannot assume that the light by which the observer sees the flashes travels at the same speed along both paths. This assumption would require the means to measure time, which we don't have yet. So, it seems there is a logical circle in our reasoning.  But the suggestion prevails despite the objection. The definition of simultaneity doesn't depend on the nature of light; it only requires an empirical decision based on observation. The notion that light travels the same time along both paths is a stipulation made for the purpose of defining simultaneity.  This definition can be extended to multiple events regardless of their positions with respect to a reference point like the railway embankment. It also leads to a definition of time in physics. Clocks with the same construction are placed at different points, and the time of an event is determined by the reading of the clock nearest to it. This assumption implies that clocks go at the same rate if they are identical. This hypothesis is believed to be true unless proven otherwise by empirical evidence.

## 9. The Relativity of Simultaneity

Have you ever wondered if events happening at the same time for one person would also be happening at the same time for another person in a different frame of reference? Well, according to the theory of relativity, the answer is no. In this particular scenario, imagine a train traveling at a constant velocity. People on the train see the train as a fixed reference point. Now, if two lightning strikes happen at the same time on the train tracks, people on the train will see them as happening at different times. This is because the train is moving towards one lightning strike and away from the other, creating a difference in when the light reaches the observers. This shows that events that are simultaneous for one frame of reference may not be simultaneous for another. This challenges the notion that time has absolute significance, independent of the motion of the observer. Previously, it was assumed that an event would take the same amount of time regardless of the frame of reference. However, by considering the relativity of simultaneity, we realize that this assumption conflicts with the propagation of light in a vacuum. By letting go of this assumption, we can resolve the conflict and understand that time is relative to the observer's frame of reference. So, it's important to specify the reference frame when talking about the timing of events. This new understanding of time opens up a whole new perspective on the nature of reality.

## 10. On the Relativity of the Conception of Distance

Consider two points on a moving train. To measure the distance between them, we need a reference point. We can use the train itself as a reference. A person on the train marks off the distance using a measuring rod. However, if we want to measure the distance from the railway line, we need to determine the points on the embankment that correspond to the moving points on the train. This can be done by using the concept of time. We then measure the distance between these two points on the embankment using a measuring rod. It is important to note that the distance measured from the embankment may not be the same as the distance measured within the train. Therefore, we need to be cautious when considering distances from different reference points.

## 11. The Lorentz Transformation

In our previous discussions, we found that the law of propagation of light seemed incompatible with the principle of relativity. However, this was based on two unjustifiable hypotheses borrowed from classical mechanics. If we remove these hypotheses, we can resolve the apparent disagreement between the two fundamental results of experience. To do this, we need to consider the relationship between the place and time of an event relative to both the train and the embankment. Can we find a thinkable answer to this question that allows for the compatibility of the law of light transmission in vacuo with the principle of relativity? The answer is yes. We can imagine two reference bodies, the embankment and the train, each with their own co-ordinate systems. By introducing a framework of rods to supplement the embankment and extending the train across space, we can localize any event with respect to these frameworks. Now, the question is: given the place and time of an event with respect to the embankment (K), what are the values of the same event with respect to the train (K')? The relationships between these values must satisfy the law of light transmission in vacuo for all rays. To solve this problem, we have the Lorentz transformation, which consists of a system of equations. These equations ensure the compatibility of the law of light transmission in vacuo for both the embankment and the train. We can obtain the older Galilei transformation by substituting an infinitely large value for the velocity of light in the Lorentz transformation. To illustrate the validity of the Lorentz transformation, let's consider a light signal sent along the positive x-axis. According to the Lorentz transformation, this simple relation between x and t leads to a relation between x' and t'. In other words, the velocity of light relative to both the embankment and the train is equal to the speed of light. These findings show that the law of light transmission is compatible with the principle of relativity when we use the Lorentz transformation. The equations derived from this transformation satisfy the conditions for the propagation of light in vacuo.

## 12. The Behaviour of Measuring-Rods and Clocks in Motion

Imagine placing a meter-rod on the x-axis of a system in such a way that one end coincides with a certain point and the other end coincides with another point. We can determine the length of the rod relative to another system by observing where these two points lie in that system. When the rod is in motion with a velocity v, we find that it appears shorter than when it is at rest. The faster it moves, the shorter it appears. However, there is a limit to how fast an object can move, represented by the velocity c. If the velocity exceeds c, the equations become meaningless. This idea of c being a limiting velocity also follows from the Lorentz transformation equations. On the other hand, if we consider a meter-rod at rest in a reference system, we find that its length remains unchanged when observed from a different system. This is consistent with the principle of relativity. The behavior of measuring-rods and clocks can be understood by studying these transformation equations. For example, when a clock is in motion, it appears to tick at a slower rate compared to when it is stationary. Once again, the velocity c serves as an unattainable limit in the context of time dilation.

## 13. Theorem of the Addition of Velocities

The Experiment of Fizeau In this passage, the author discusses the concept of the addition of velocities and how it is affected by the theory of relativity. They explain that classical mechanics and the Galilei transformation can both derive the theorem of the addition of velocities, but the theory of relativity offers a different equation. To determine which theorem aligns better with experience, the author refers to an experiment conducted by Fizeau. The experiment involves light traveling through a motionless liquid, while the liquid itself is flowing through a tube. The task is to determine the velocity of light relative to the tube. The author poses this as a problem similar to the one discussed earlier in the passage. The experiment supports the equation derived from the theory of relativity, and they emphasize the accuracy of the results. It is then mentioned that a similar theory was proposed by H.A. Lorentz before the theory of relativity, but this does not lessen the significance of the experiment as a crucial test for the theory. The passage concludes by mentioning that the theory of relativity builds upon the electrodynamics of Maxwell-Lorentz, showing its connection and simplification of previously independent hypotheses.

## 14. The Heuristic Value of the Theory of Relativity

Our understanding of the natural world has led us to two important principles: the principle of relativity and the constant velocity of light. These principles have led us to a mathematical transformation known as the Lorentz transformation. It states that every general law of nature should remain the same when we change the space-time variables. This condition is called covariance. If a law does not satisfy this condition, then either the principle of relativity or the constant velocity of light would be disproved. The theory of relativity becomes a valuable tool in searching for general laws of nature because it demands covariance. So far, the theory of relativity has produced significant results.

## 15. General Results of the Theory

The special theory of relativity has greatly simplified and unified physics, particularly in the fields of electrodynamics and optics. It has reduced the number of hypotheses and provided a more streamlined theoretical framework. The theory has also led to a modification of classical mechanics, particularly in the laws that govern rapid motions. The theory states that the kinetic energy of a mass is given by a different expression, which approaches infinity as the velocity of the mass approaches the speed of light. This implies that the velocity must always be less than the speed of light, regardless of the energy used for acceleration. The theory also unifies the laws of conservation of energy and mass, showing that they are interdependent. According to the theory, if a body absorbs energy without a change in velocity, its mass increases by a corresponding amount. This means that the inertial mass of a system can be seen as a measure of its energy. Moreover, the theory asserts that there are no instantaneous actions at a distance, as predicted by Newton's law of gravitation. Instead, action at a distance occurs with the speed of light, which plays a fundamental role in the theory.

## 16. Experience and the Special Theory of Relativity

The special theory of relativity is supported by numerous experiments and observations. One significant piece of evidence comes from the study of electromagnetic phenomena, which led to the development of the theory. Through this, we can accurately predict the effects on light from fixed stars, such as the yearly movement caused by the Earth's orbit around the sun and the slight shift in spectral lines due to the relative motion of the stars. These predictions align with what we observe. There are also experiments involving cathode rays and radioactive emissions that provide support for the theory. These experiments revealed that these rays consist of electrons, which are negatively charged particles with high velocities and small inertias. However, traditional electrodynamic theory cannot fully explain the nature of these electrons, leading to the introduction of an auxiliary hypothesis. This hypothesis, proposed by Lorentz, suggests that the electron contracts in the direction of its motion. The theory of relativity arrives at the same conclusion without requiring this extra hypothesis, demonstrating its validity. Additionally, experiments aimed at detecting the motion of the Earth in space have yielded negative results. Prior to the theory of relativity, this posed a challenge as it contradicted the assumption that the Galileian transformation would apply to different reference frames. The theory overcomes this by eliminating the need for a preferred reference frame or the concept of an aether. The famous Michelson-Morley experiment, designed to detect an aether-drift, failed to show any evidence of it. Lorentz and Fitzgerald's explanation involved a contraction of moving bodies to compensate for the expected time differences, a solution that the theory of relativity also supports. In conclusion, the special theory of relativity finds substantial support from various experiments and observations. It aligns with the behavior of electromagnetic phenomena, provides an accurate description of the behavior of electrons, and removes the need for additional hypotheses concerning the motion of the Earth or the existence of an aether.

## 17. Minkowski’s Four-Dimensional Space

The concept of a four-dimensional world can be quite perplexing to those of us who aren't mathematicians. We are familiar with our three-dimensional space, where we can describe the position of a point using three coordinates. However, in the world of physics, we need to consider time as well, making it a four-dimensional continuum. Each event in this continuum is described by its three-dimensional spatial coordinates and a time coordinate. Before the theory of relativity, time was treated differently from space coordinates. It was considered independent and absolute. But according to the theory of relativity, time loses its independence and becomes interconnected with space. This means that the time difference of two events observed from different frames of reference does not necessarily coincide. The discovery made by Minkowski emphasizes the relationship between the four-dimensional space-time continuum and the three-dimensional Euclidean space. To understand this relationship, we can replace the time coordinate with an imaginary magnitude proportional to it. This change allows the laws of physics to be expressed in a mathematical form where the time coordinate is equivalent to the space coordinates. This addition brings clarity to the theory of relativity. Minkowski's work laid the foundation for the general theory of relativity, although it may be challenging for those without a mathematical background. However, an exact understanding of this work isn't necessary to grasp the fundamental ideas of the special and general theories of relativity. Without Minkowski's contribution, the theory of relativity may not have progressed as far as it has. So, despite its difficulty, we should appreciate the important idea he introduced.

## 18. Special and General Principle of Relativity

In analyzing the principle of relativity, we must understand that all motion is relative and can be viewed from different reference points. Whether we consider the embankment or the railway carriage as our reference-body, the description of the motion remains the same. This principle of relativity applies to the general laws of nature as well. The laws of mechanics and the propagation of light have the same form regardless of the reference-body chosen. However, this principle is not applicable to all bodies of reference, but only those in a state of uniform rectilinear and non-rotary motion. Now, let's consider the general principle of relativity, which states that all bodies of reference are equivalent for describing natural phenomena, regardless of their state of motion. However, attempting to venture into the general principle seems daunting. Imagine being in a moving railway carriage. While the carriage moves uniformly, we don't feel its motion and interpret the embankment as the one in motion. This interpretation aligns with the special principle of relativity.  However, when the carriage's motion changes to a non-uniform one, like when the brakes are applied, we feel a powerful jerk forward. The mechanical behavior of bodies in the carriage differs from the previous scenario, and it seems impossible for the same mechanical laws to hold for the non-uniformly moving carriage. This suggests a kind of absolute physical reality for non-uniform motion, contradicting the general principle of relativity. But, we will soon discover that this conclusion cannot be maintained. In summary, the special principle of relativity states that the laws of nature have the same form for all bodies of reference in uniform motion. The general principle of relativity goes further, suggesting that all reference bodies are equivalent, regardless of their motion. However, the non-uniform motion challenges this idea, leading to a temporary acceptance of absolute physical reality for such motion. But this conclusion will soon be challenged.

## 19. The Gravitational Field

Imagine you're holding a stone and you let it go. Why does it fall to the ground? The usual answer is that it's attracted by the Earth. But modern physics has a different explanation. We now understand that action at a distance, like the Earth attracting the stone, requires the presence of a medium. Just like a magnet creates a magnetic field that acts on a piece of iron, the Earth creates a gravitational field that acts on the stone. This field diminishes with distance from the Earth, following a specific law. Unlike electric and magnetic fields, the gravitational field has a unique property: any object moving solely under the influence of gravity experiences the same acceleration, regardless of its material or physical state. This can be explained using Newton's laws of motion. If we consider gravity as the cause of acceleration, we realize that the ratio of gravitational mass to inertial mass is constant for all objects. This leads to the conclusion that the gravitational mass of a body is equal to its inertial mass. This important law had been observed in mechanics but hadn't been fully understood. The interpretation is that the same quality of a body, depending on the circumstances, can be perceived as inertia or weight. This realization is connected to the general postulate of relativity.

## 20. The Equality of Inertial and Gravitational Mass as an Argument for the General Postulate of Relativity

Imagine a scenario in which we find ourselves in an empty space far away from any stars or massive objects. Within this space, we have a spacious chest that resembles a room, and inside this chest is an observer equipped with various instruments. The interesting thing is that within this environment, gravitation does not exist. In order to prevent the observer from floating around, they must be fastened to the floor with strings. Now, let's imagine that there is a hook with a rope attached to the middle of the lid of the chest. And let's say that someone outside the chest starts pulling on this rope with a constant force. As a result, the chest and the observer inside begin to accelerate "upwards" in a uniform and continuous manner. Over time, their velocity will reach extremely high values, as seen from another reference point that is not being pulled. But how does the observer inside the chest perceive this situation? Well, the acceleration of the chest is transmitted to the observer through the reaction of the floor. In order to not be knocked down by this acceleration, the observer must exert pressure on the floor with their legs. In this way, the observer stands inside the chest just like anyone would stand in a room on Earth. If the observer releases an object that they were holding, the acceleration of the chest will no longer be transferred to that object. As a result, the object will appear to move towards the floor of the chest with an accelerated motion relative to the observer. Interestingly, the observer realizes that the acceleration of the falling object towards the floor is always the same, regardless of the object used for the experiment. Based on the observer's knowledge of the gravitational field, they come to the conclusion that they and the chest are in a gravitational field that remains constant over time. They are momentarily puzzled as to why the chest doesn't fall in this gravitational field. However, upon discovering the hook and rope on the lid of the chest, they conclude that the chest is actually suspended at rest in this gravitational field. We might be tempted to think that the observer's conclusion is incorrect, but in order to remain consistent, we must acknowledge that it is a valid interpretation. Even though the chest is accelerating with respect to the reference-body initially considered, we can still treat the chest as being at rest. This leads us to extend the principle of relativity to include accelerated bodies of reference, which strengthens the argument for a generalized principle of relativity. It's important to note that this mode of interpretation relies on the fundamental property of the gravitational field, which gives all bodies the same acceleration. This property is equivalent to the equality of inertial and gravitational mass. Without this natural law, the observer in the accelerated chest wouldn't be able to explain the behavior of objects around them based on the assumption of a gravitational field, and they wouldn't be justified in considering their reference-body as being "at rest".

Suppose the observer inside the chest attaches a rope to the inner side of the lid and hangs a body from it. The rope will stretch and hang vertically downward. When asked about the tension in the rope, the observer inside the chest would attribute it to the downward force experienced by the suspended body in the gravitational field. They would explain that the tension of the rope is necessary to balance this force, and the magnitude of the tension depends on the gravitational mass of the hanging body. On the other hand, an observer freely suspended in space would interpret the situation differently. They would see that the rope is part of the accelerated motion of the chest and transfers this motion to the hanging body. The tension in the rope is precisely enough to cause the acceleration of the body, and its magnitude depends on the inertial mass of the body. By considering this example, we can see that our extension of the principle of relativity implies the law of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass. This provides a physical interpretation of this law. From the analysis of the accelerated chest, it becomes apparent that a general theory of relativity would yield significant insights into the laws governing gravitation. In fact, the systematic exploration of the concept of relativity has led to the formulation of the laws that govern the gravitational field. It's worth noting that even though there was no gravitational field for the initially chosen reference-body, a gravitational field exists for the observer inside the chest. This indicates that the existence of a gravitational field is not always an apparent one. It's not possible to choose a reference-body that eliminates the gravitational field of the Earth entirely. Only for certain specific forms of gravitational fields can we choose a reference-body in which no gravitational field exists. This understanding helps us address a misconception that was raised against the general principle of relativity in a previous section. The observer in a moving railway carriage may experience a jolt when the brakes are applied, which indicates the non-uniform motion or deceleration of the carriage. However, there is no compulsion to attribute this jolt to a "real" acceleration or deceleration of the carriage. Instead, one could interpret the experience as a result of a gravitational field that is directed forwards and varies with time with respect to the reference-body (the carriage). This gravitational field influences the motion of the embankment and the Earth in such a way that their original velocity backward is continuously reduced. These insights show us the profound implications of the principle of relativity for understanding the laws of gravitation and invite us to delve further into the development of a general theory of relativity.

## 21. In What Respects Are the Foundations of Classical Mechanics and of the Special Theory of Relativity Unsatisfactory?

Have you ever wondered why certain things behave differently depending on the context? Like when you see two pans on a gas range, and one emits steam while the other doesn't. It's natural to be curious about the reason behind this difference. Similarly, in classical mechanics and the special theory of relativity, there are certain reference points or states of motion that hold the laws of nature, while others don't. This raises the question of why this preference exists.  Think of it this way: imagine standing in front of those pans and noticing that only one emits steam. If you then saw a bluish something under that pan, you would understand that it is the cause of the steam. However, if you saw no such thing and the steam emission still differed between the two pans, you would be perplexed until you found an explanation for this variation.  In the same manner, we search for a concrete reason in classical mechanics or the special theory of relativity that could account for the distinct behavior observed in different reference systems. Sir Isaac Newton attempted to dismiss this question, but it remained unresolved. E. Mach, on the other hand, recognized this dilemma and proposed a new foundation for mechanics.  The only way to overcome this problem is by adopting a physics that adheres to the general principle of relativity, where the equations apply to every reference point regardless of its motion. This would provide a comprehensive explanation for the differing behavior of bodies in different reference systems.

## 22. A Few Inferences from the General Principle of Relativity

In the realm of theoretical physics, the principle of relativity allows us to determine the properties of gravitational fields through mathematical calculations. By studying how natural processes occur in one reference frame, we can deduce how they appear in an accelerated reference frame. This knowledge also reveals how gravitational fields influence these processes. For instance, we find that a body in uniform motion with respect to one reference frame undergoes accelerated and curvilinear motion in an accelerated frame due to the gravitational field. This is a well-known consequence of gravitational influence on moving bodies. However, when we consider the path of a ray of light, we make a remarkable discovery. In the original reference frame, the ray of light travels in a straight line with a constant velocity. But when observed from an accelerated frame, we find that light rays propagate along curved paths in the presence of gravitational fields. This result has two significant implications. Firstly, it can be compared to reality. Although the curvature of light rays due to gravitational fields is generally minuscule, it becomes notable when light passes close to massive objects like the sun. During a total solar eclipse, fixed stars near the sun should appear slightly displaced due to this curvature. Verifying this deduction is a vital task for astronomers. Secondly, this result challenges the assumption of the constancy of the speed of light in a vacuum, a fundamental premise in the special theory of relativity. According to the general theory of relativity, the propagation velocity of light can vary depending on the position. Thus, the special theory of relativity, and the entire theory of relativity, cannot claim unlimited validity and must consider the influence of gravitational fields on phenomena like light.

Critics of relativity have often argued that the general theory invalidates the special theory. However, a suitable analogy clarifies the situation. Before the development of electrodynamics, electrostatics was regarded as the complete theory of electricity. Yet, we now know that electric fields can only be correctly derived from electrostatics when the charged masses are completely at rest relative to each other. However, electrodynamics includes electrostatics as a limiting case. Similarly, the special theory of relativity is a subset of the general theory, and its results apply only when gravitational fields can be disregarded. Returning to the transmission of light in gravitational fields, the general theory of relativity not only explains the influence of such fields on known natural processes but also offers a means to investigate the laws governing the gravitational field itself. By considering reference frames with different motions, we can create variable gravitational fields. The challenge lies in determining the general law that governs all possible gravitational fields, and this requires expanding our understanding of the space-time continuum.

## 23. Behaviour of Clocks and Measuring-Rods on a Rotating Body of Reference

The author acknowledges that they have neglected discussing the physical interpretation of space- and time-data in the general theory of relativity. They explain that this is a crucial aspect and it's time to address it. They use the example of a rotating circular disc to illustrate their point. They mention that an observer on the disc would perceive a force acting outwards, which they interpret as an effect of inertia. However, the observer on the disc can consider the disc itself as "at rest" and interpret the force as a gravitational field. They note that this gravitational field's space-distribution is different from what would be expected in Newton's theory of gravitation, but this does not bother the observer who believes in the general theory of relativity. The author then discusses the observer's experiments with clocks and measuring-rods on the disc to define time- and space-data. They reveal that clocks situated at different positions on the disc go at different rates, as observed from the non-rotating reference-body K. Similarly, the definition of simultaneity faces difficulties in this case. The author also mentions that measuring the circumference and diameter of the disc with a measuring-rod yields a different result than expected, showing that the propositions of Euclidean geometry do not hold on the rotating disc. These challenges lead the author to conclude that the previous conclusions based on general relativity are in question. However, they explain that a subtle detour must be taken to apply the postulate of general relativity accurately. They hint at explaining this detour in the following paragraphs.

## 24. Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Continuum

Imagine a marble table spread out in front of you. You can move from one point on the table to any other by continuously passing from one point to a nearby one. This property of the surface is called a continuum.  Now, let's imagine that we have many little rods of equal length. We lay four of these rods on the table to create a square. We continue adding squares, each sharing one rod with the previous one, until the entire table is covered with squares. The arrangement ensures that each side of a square belongs to two squares and each corner to four squares. It's quite amazing that we can do this without major difficulties. However, there are some cases where it becomes impossible to create squares with equal diagonals. But if everything goes smoothly, we can say that the points on the table form a Euclidean continuum based on the little rod used as a distance measure. By choosing one corner of a square as an "origin," we can describe every other corner using two numbers. These numbers represent the number of rods we need to pass when moving from the origin to the desired corner, first horizontally and then vertically. These are the Cartesian coordinates of the corner with respect to the coordinate system determined by the arrangement of the rods. Now, let's consider a modification of this experiment. We heat the central part of the table, causing the little rods to expand while the outer part remains unaffected. In this case, our construction of squares would become disordered because the rods expand unevenly. With this modification, the table is no longer a Euclidean continuum with respect to our little rods, and we can no longer define Cartesian coordinates directly. However, we can still maintain the view that the table is a Euclidean continuum by making a more subtle stipulation about the measurement or comparison of lengths. If all rods behave the same way as the temperature changes and we have no other means of detecting this effect, we would assign the distance one to two points on the table if the ends of a rod can be made to coincide with those points. Otherwise, it would be arbitrary to define the distance. This means we would need to discard the method of Cartesian coordinates and use another method that does not assume the validity of Euclidean geometry for rigid bodies. This situation corresponds to the general postulate of relativity.

## 25. Gaussian Co-Ordinates

In the world of mathematics, Gauss introduced a method for dealing with continua, which are objects that can be divided into infinitely small parts. He devised a system of coordinates known as Gauss coordinates, which assigns numbers to each point in the continuum. These coordinates are based on the principle that neighboring points have similar values, with extremely small differences. This system can be applied to continua of any number of dimensions. For a continuum to be considered Euclidean, the behavior of its parts must resemble that of Euclidean geometry. Gauss coordinates are a logical extension of Cartesian coordinates, and they can be used to study non-Euclidean continua as well, as long as small regions of the continuum exhibit Euclidean-like behavior.

## 26. The Space-Time Continuum of the Special Theory of Relativity Considered as a Euclidean Continuum

Minkowski's idea, based on the special theory of relativity, is to give preference to certain coordinate systems called "Galileian coordinate systems" to describe the four-dimensional space-time continuum. These systems have four coordinates that determine an event or a point in the continuum. The transition from one Galileian system to another, moving uniformly with respect to the first, is described by the Lorentz transformations. These transformations express the law of transmission of light and are the basis for deductions from the special theory of relativity. Minkowski found that the Lorentz transformations satisfy a simple condition, which states that the magnitude belonging to two neighboring points in the space-time continuum is the same for all selected reference-bodies. This magnitude, called "distance," can be regarded as the distance between the two events or points. By using an imaginary variable as the time-variable, the space-time continuum can be seen as a Euclidean four-dimensional continuum.

## 27. The Space-Time Continuum of the General Theory of Relativity is Not a Euclidean Continuum

In this part of the book, we explore the concept of space-time continuum in relation to the general theory of relativity. We discover that this continuum cannot be considered as a Euclidean one, as it is affected by the presence of a gravitational field. Instead, it resembles a two-dimensional continuum with varying properties, like a marble slab with localized temperature variations. We then learn that it is impossible to construct a Cartesian coordinate system from rigid bodies and clocks in this context. However, by using Gaussian coordinates, we can assign four numbers to each point in the continuum (event), which allows us to label and describe them, even though these coordinates do not have direct physical significance. We must understand that the true evidence of a time-space nature comes from encounters between points in motion, which are represented by lines in the continuum. Descriptions of the motion of a material point relative to a reference body are based on these encounters. Moreover, we can determine the values of time by observing encounters of the body with clocks. Thus, the description of the continuum using Gaussian coordinates replaces the need for a reference body and overcomes its limitations. It is not bound by the Euclidean nature of the continuum it represents.

## 28. Exact Formulation of the General Principle of Relativity

In the realm of describing natural phenomena, we can now establish a more precise formulation of the general principle of relativity. The previous provision, which stated that all bodies of reference are equivalent, needs to be revised because the use of rigid reference bodies is not generally applicable in a space-time description. Instead, we can replace this with the statement that all Gaussian coordinate systems are essentially equivalent for formulating the general laws of nature. Another way to understand this principle is that any transformation of Gaussian variables should result in equations of the same form, regardless of the specific transformation used. In the special theory of relativity, this transformation is the Lorentz transformation, but in the general theory, any arbitrary substitution of the Gaussian variables is applicable. Essentially, in the general theory of relativity, the concept of rigid bodies and the simplistic view of time are not sufficient. Non-rigid reference bodies and clocks are used, allowing for alterations and irregularities in motion and form. These clocks, placed on the non-rigid reference body, define time based on simultaneous observations. The non-rigid reference body, referred to as a "reference-mollusc," is essentially an arbitrary Gaussian coordinate system that retains the separate existence of space and time coordinates. The general principle of relativity dictates that all these reference-molluscs can be used equally effectively in formulating the laws of nature, and the laws themselves must be independent of the choice of mollusc. The power of the general principle of relativity lies in the comprehensive limitations it imposes on the laws of nature based on the aforementioned principles.

## 29. The Solution of the Problem of Gravitation on the Basis of the General Principle of Relativity

In order to understand the solution to the problem of gravitation, we start with a Galileian domain where there is no gravitational field. We know how measuring rods, clocks, and material points behave in this domain. Now, if we refer this domain to a different reference body, there will be a gravitational field. We can understand the behavior of measuring rods, clocks, and material points in this gravitational field by using mathematical transformations. Based on this, we introduce the hypothesis that the influence of the gravitational field on these objects continues to follow the same laws even if the gravitational field is not derivable from the Galileian special case by a transformation of coordinates. The next step is to study the space-time behavior of the gravitational field derived from the Galileian special case. This behavior is formulated in a law that is always valid, regardless of the choice of reference-body. However, this law only applies to a special kind of gravitational field. To find the general law of the gravitational field, we need to generalize this law by considering certain demands. The general principle of relativity allows us to determine the influence of the gravitational field on processes that occur in the absence of a gravitational field, as long as these processes have already been described within the framework of the special theory of relativity.  By using this principle, we can develop a theory of gravitation that not only provides a beautiful description but also resolves the deficiencies of classical mechanics and explains the empirical law of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass. Moreover, this theory has already explained an astronomical observation that classical mechanics cannot account for. When we apply this theory to weak gravitational fields and slow-moving masses, we obtain the Newtonian theory as a first approximation. However, with more precise calculations, deviations from Newtonian theory become apparent. These deviations are usually too small to be measured but one notable exception is the orbit of the planet Mercury. According to Newton's theory, the orbit should remain fixed with respect to the fixed stars, but it was observed that the orbit of Mercury rotates slowly in the plane of its motion. The general theory of relativity predicts this rotation and the calculated value matches the observed value to a high degree of precision. Apart from this, the theory of relativity has been confirmed by other observations as well, such as the curvature of light rays by the gravitational field of the sun and the displacement of spectral lines from stars compared to those produced on Earth. Overall, the theory of gravitation derived from the general postulate of relativity not only provides a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of gravity but also has been supported by experimental evidence.

## 30. Cosmological Difficulties of Newton’s Theory

In classical celestial mechanics, there are two fundamental difficulties. The first one is the view that the universe is infinite in space and time, with stars scattered everywhere. This contradicts Newton's theory, which suggests that the universe should have a center where the density of stars is highest and decreases as you move away from it. This idea of a finite universe seems unsatisfactory because it implies that the light emitted by stars will forever be lost in infinite space, never interacting with other objects. To overcome this, some propose modifying Newton's law so that the force of attraction between masses decreases more rapidly with distance. However, this modification lacks both empirical and theoretical support. Ultimately, there is no clear reason to prefer one modified law over others.

## 31. The Possibility of a “Finite” and yet “Unbounded” Universe

Imagine a world where beings exist on a two-dimensional plane. They can move freely within this plane and their whole reality is limited to what they observe within it. Their understanding of space is based on their ability to perform Euclidean geometry using rods as measuring tools. In their two-dimensional universe, there is infinite space and an infinite number of identical squares made up of rods. Now, let's consider another two-dimensional existence, but this time on a spherical surface. These beings also have measuring rods and other objects that fit perfectly on the surface of the sphere. However, their universe is not infinite like the previous flat beings. Instead, it has a finite area and is bounded by the sphere's surface. If they try to create a straight line, they will end up with a curve known as a great circle. This is different from the Euclidean concept of a straight line. These beings can measure the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter and find that it is smaller than what we consider to be the constant value of pi. They can also determine the radius of their universe based on this ratio. Interestingly, these spherical beings can barely distinguish between living in a finite or infinite universe. If they only have access to a small part of their spherical surface, it would appear nearly indistinguishable from a flat plane. They can only truly comprehend the finite nature of their universe when they look at larger parts of the sphere. The choice of a sphere as their universe is of significance because all points on a sphere are equivalent. The sphere has a constant curvature, and its properties allow us to draw parallels between a two-dimensional spherical surface and a three-dimensional spherical space, as discovered by Riemann. Just like the two-dimensional surface, the three-dimensional spherical space is finite and has no boundaries. It is possible to imagine such a spherical space by extending strings or lines from a central point and measuring the distances with a rod. In conclusion, this discussion raises an intriguing question for scientists: is our universe infinite or finite like the spherical universe? Unfortunately, our current knowledge and experience are not enough to answer this question definitively. However, the general theory of relativity offers some insights, and it suggests that the universe may indeed be finite, similar to the spherical model. Solving this puzzle is crucial for astronomers and physicists alike.

## 32. The Structure of Space According to the General Theory of Relativity

According to the theory of relativity, the properties of space are determined by matter. We can make conclusions about the geometry of the universe by considering the matter at rest. Although our universe is not exactly Euclidean, it is close to it, with slight irregularities. However, in order for there to be an average density of matter in the universe, it cannot be quasi-Euclidean; instead, it would have to be spherical or elliptical. The actual distribution of matter in the universe deviates from uniform, so the universe is quasi-spherical. It is also finite and has a connection between its size and the average density of matter.
